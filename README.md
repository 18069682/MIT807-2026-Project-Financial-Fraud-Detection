📖 Project Overview

Financial fraud poses a major threat to financial institutions and customers globally. This project leverages big data analytics and machine learning models to enhance fraud detection accuracy and minimize false positives in large-scale financial transactions.

Using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, the study explores how different algorithms can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions under extreme class imbalance conditions. The research contributes to improving the robustness and interpretability of fraud detection frameworks in real-world financial environments.

🎯 Research Objectives

Analyze the Kaggle credit card dataset to understand transaction behavior patterns.

Develop machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks) for fraud classification.

Address the class imbalance problem using techniques such as SMOTE and anomaly detection.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Propose a scalable framework for early fraud detection using big data analytics.

❓ Research Questions

How effective are machine learning models in detecting fraudulent financial transactions?

What impact does data imbalance have on model performance and detection accuracy?

Which algorithm provides the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost?

Can feature engineering and big data analytics improve fraud detection in financial datasets?
